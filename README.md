Big thank you '2black0'!

Now rying to get it on win 10  64bit machine this way:
importing adafruit_ble lib
search and connect the device with the correct name, works good.
write a request, using "adafruit_ble.characteristics"  the word:'led' in this case - can't make it so far
read a 5 words (10 bytes) data - can't make it as well
Disconnecting works good too
Please help if you can
Thank you
